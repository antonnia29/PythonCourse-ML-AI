# PythonCourse - ML & AI
Repo for machine learning and AI projects.

These projects cover the use of sklearn matrics, seaborn matplotlib, SpaCy to test and training data split, descision tree classifier, random forest classifier, pruning, max_depth and accuracy scores, feature importance.

It also covers, neural network, natural language processing, mnist, confusion matrix.



1. KMeans_task -
2. Decision Tree Titanic - in this task we look at using the decision tree classifier on titanic dataset. Import matplotlib, sklearn metrics and tree. As part of data preprocessing for the classifiers, One-Hot encoding is used to assign label to the sex and embarked datasets, before splitting and pruning data. then determined most suitable max_depth value against accuracy score. The feature importance shows which of the x features are most important against the y feature.
